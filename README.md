# Please get codes from master branch

Hi,
  My effort for this task is about one day. All my testcases are under crypto_task/testcase folder respectively.

Notes:
1. set python environment on your PC
2. instail libraries in the requirements.txt
3. add crypto_task/api and crypto_task/config to your PPYTHONPATH


Have you any concerns, connect me with email injuly88@163.com.
